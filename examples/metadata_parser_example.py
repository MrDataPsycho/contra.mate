Example usage of MetadataParserAgent for extracting contract metadata.

This example shows how to:
1. Initialize the agent with any BaseChatClient implementation
2. Extract structured metadata from contract text (returns dict)
3. Create ContractEsmd model with project_id and reference_doc_id
4. Handle batching for large documents automatically
5. Handle exceptions from the agent
