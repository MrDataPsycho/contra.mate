      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Common payment terms in contracts typically include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Payment is often due within a specified period after invoice receipt, commonly net 30 days. For example, in manufacturing outsourcing agreements, payment by the client is due thirty (30) days from the date of invoice issuance [doc1].\n",
      "\n",
      "- In transportation service agreements, payment is generally due within 15 days of the invoice date, with late payments accruing interest at a specified rate (e.g., 2% per annum) [doc2].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Consulting agreements may specify payment in equal quarterly installments, such as an annual consulting fee paid in four equal quarterly payments on specified dates [doc3][doc4].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Supply agreements often require payment in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the date of shipment, with provisions for advance payment or modification of payment terms in case of changes in circumstances [doc6].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reseller agreements commonly require invoices to be paid within 30 calendar days from the invoice date or when the amount is due, with late charges applied at a rate such as 1% per month [doc7].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hosting agreements may specify payment due by month-end for invoices received by a certain date, otherwise payment is due 30 days from receipt of invoice, including late payment fees [doc5].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Transportation contracts may require payment promptly upon performance, with amounts more than 30 days past due bearing interest at a prime rate plus a percentage, and payments made at the carrier's office [doc10].\n",
      "\n",
      "These terms often include provisions for late payment interest or fees, advance payments in certain circumstances, and payment in specified currencies. The exact terms vary by contract type and industry but net 30 days is a common standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "References:\n",

They also indemnify each other against claims of intellectual property infringement related to the system. Except for personal injury or death caused by negligence, the liability of either party for any claims arising from performance or nonperformance under the agreement is limited to the amount of payments made under the agreement [doc1].\n",

This limitation applies regardless of the basis of liability, including contract, tort, or strict liability, even if the party has been warned of the possibility of such damages. Additionally, neither party is liable for damages arising from delays in manufacture, shipment, or delivery if such delays are due to force majeure events. The agreement also includes indemnity provisions where the Manufacturer indemnifies the Subcontractor against claims related to intellectual property infringement, product safety compliance failures, or damages caused by negligence or defects in Manufacturer specifications [doc2].\n",
