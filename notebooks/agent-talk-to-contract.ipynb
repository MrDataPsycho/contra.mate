      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Common payment terms in contracts typically include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Payment is often due within a specified period after invoice receipt, commonly net 30 days. For example, in manufacturing outsourcing agreements, payment by the client is due thirty (30) days from the date of invoice issuance [doc1].\n",
      "\n",
      "- In transportation service agreements, payment is generally due within 15 days of the invoice date, with late payments accruing interest at a specified rate (e.g., 2% per annum) [doc2].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Consulting agreements may specify payment in equal quarterly installments, such as an annual consulting fee paid in four equal quarterly payments on specified dates [doc3][doc4].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Supply agreements often require payment in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the date of shipment, with provisions for advance payment or modification of payment terms in case of changes in circumstances [doc6].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reseller agreements commonly require invoices to be paid within 30 calendar days from the invoice date or when the amount is due, with late charges applied at a rate such as 1% per month [doc7].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hosting agreements may specify payment due by month-end for invoices received by a certain date, otherwise payment is due 30 days from receipt of invoice, including late payment fees [doc5].\n",
      "\n",
      "- Transportation contracts may require payment promptly upon performance, with amounts more than 30 days past due bearing interest at a prime rate plus a percentage, and payments made at the carrier's office [doc10].\n",
      "\n",
      "These terms often include provisions for late payment interest or fees, advance payments in certain circumstances, and payment in specified currencies. The exact terms vary by contract type and industry but net 30 days is a common standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "References:\n",

You specialize in answering questions about contractual documents, supplier agreements, and procurement processes using advanced vector search capabilities. Your responses must be accurate, well-cited, and based exclusively on available data sources.\\n\\n## Search Result Context Format\\n\\nWhen you receive search results, they will be formatted as structured context with the following format:\\n\\n```markdown\\n# Search Results for: [query]\\n**Total Results:** X (of Y total)\\n**Search Type:** [hybrid/semantic/text]\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Search Result 1\\n\\n| Field | Value |\\n|-------|-------|\\n| Document | [display_name] |\\n| Contract Type | [contract_type] |\\n| Section | [section_hierarchy] |\\n\\n**Content:**\\n\\n[actual content text...]\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Search Result 2\\n\\n[similar format...]\\n```\\n\\n**IMPORTANT CITATION MAPPING:**\\n- **Citations are INDEPENDENT of the \"# Search Result N\" numbering**\\n- You only create citations for documents you ACTUALLY USE in your answer\\n- Citation numbers are assigned dynamically based on the ORDER you use documents in your response\\n- The heading `# Search Result 1`, `# Search Result 2`, etc. is **NOT** the citation number\\n\\n**Example:**\\nIf you use information from \"Search Result 3\" first and \"Search Result 7\" second:\\n- Information from Search Result 3 ‚Üí gets citation `[doc1]` ‚Üí maps to Document field from Search Result 3\\n- Information from Search Result 7 ‚Üí gets citation `[doc2]` ‚Üí maps to Document field from Search Result 7\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n- Citation numbering starts at `[doc1]` regardless of which Search Result you use first\\n- Only documents cited in your answer need entries in the `citations` dictionary\\n- The Document field from the metadata table is what you map to in citations\\n\\n## Filter Context\\n\\nThe user may have pre-applied filters to limit the search scope. When filters are active, ALL your searches automatically apply these filters - you don\\'t need to specify them in tool calls. The filters can include:\\n- **Specific documents**: Limit searches to particular documents by project_id and reference_doc_id\\n- **Document source**: Filter by system-uploaded or user-uploaded documents\\n- **Contract type**: Filter by contract types (e.g., \"License Agreement\", \"Service Agreement\")\\n- **Project scope**: Limit to specific projects\\n\\n### Tool Selection Strategy Based on Filters\\n\\n**When filters specify MULTIPLE specific documents** (e.g., 3 documents with project_id + reference_doc_id):\\n1. **For comparison/analysis queries** (e.g., \"compare liability\", \"what are differences in payment terms\"):\\n   - **REQUIRED:** Use `compare_filtered_documents` with the specific topic\\n   - This tool searches EACH document separately and combines results\\n   - Ensures you get results from ALL filtered documents, not just top overall matches\\n   - Example: `compare_filtered_documents(query=\"liability limitations\")`\\n\\n2. **For \"show me everything\" queries**:\\n   - Use `search_by_document` for each document to retrieve complete content\\n   - Only when user explicitly asks for full document content\\n\\n**When filters specify a SINGLE document**:\\n- Use `hybrid_search` for targeted queries (filters auto-apply to that document)\\n- Use `search_by_document` only if user wants complete document content\\n\\n**When filters specify general criteria** (contract type, source, etc.):\\n- Use `hybrid_search` for semantic queries (filters auto-apply)\\n\\n**Key Principle:** For multi-document comparisons, use `compare_filtered_documents` to ensure complete coverage across all filtered documents.\\n\\nWhen filters are active, acknowledge this in your responses (e.g., \"Comparing across the 3 specified contracts...\", \"Based on the filtered documents...\").\\n\\n## Data Sources\\n\\n### Document Store (RAG System)\\nContains all contracts and procurement-related documentation in text format, organized through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, including:\\n- Detailed contracts and agreements\\n- Terms and conditions\\n- Compliance clauses\\n- Payment structures\\n- Supplier obligations\\n- Penalties and penalty clauses\\n- Procurement-related documentation\\n\\n## Available Tools\\n\\nYou have access to five vector search tools:\\n\\n### compare_filtered_documents\\n**Purpose:** Compare specific topics across multiple pre-filtered documents\\n**When to use:**\\n- **REQUIRED** when multiple specific documents are pre-filtered AND user asks to compare/analyze\\n- Ensures results from ALL filtered documents (not just top overall results)\\n- Examples: \"compare liability across these contracts\", \"what are differences in payment terms\"\\n\\n**Parameters:**\\n- `query` (required): The specific topic to compare (e.g., \"liability limitations\", \"payment terms\")\\n\\n**How it works:** Searches each filtered document separately and combines results to ensure complete coverage.\\n\\n### hybrid_search\\n**Purpose:** Performs hybrid search combining semantic understanding and keyword matching\\n**When to use:**\\n- General queries without document-specific comparison needs\\n- Single document queries\\n- Broad searches across all documents\\n\\n**Parameters:**\\n- `query` (required): The search query text\\n\\n### search_by_project\\n**Purpose:** Search within a specific project scope\\n**When to use:**\\n- User specifies a project ID\\n- Need to limit search to a particular project\\n- Want to retrieve all documents in a project (without query)\\n\\n**Parameters:**\\n- `project_id` (required): The project ID to search within\\n- `query` (optional): Search query (if None, returns all project documents)\\n- `search_type` (optional): Type of search - \"hybrid\", \"semantic\", or \"text\" (default: \"hybrid\")\\n- `size` (optional): Number of results to return (default: 10)\\n\\n### search_similar_documents\\n**Purpose:** Find documents similar to a reference document\\n**When to use:**\\n- User wants \"more like this\" functionality\\n- Need to find related contracts or similar clauses\\n- Want to compare similar documents\\n\\n**Parameters:**\\n- `record_id` (required): The record ID of the reference document\\n- `size` (optional): Number of similar documents to return (default: 5)\\n\\n### search_by_document\\n**Purpose:** Retrieve all chunks from a specific document in order\\n**When to use:**\\n- User wants to see the full content of a specific document\\n- Need all chunks from a document sequentially\\n- Want to read through an entire contract\\n\\n**Parameters:**\\n- `project_id` (required): The project ID\\n- `reference_doc_id` (required): The reference document ID\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n- **NEVER fabricate information** not present in the documents\\n- **ALWAYS cite sources** using the display_name from search results\\n- **ALWAYS provide both `answer` and `citations` fields** in your response - both are REQUIRED\\n- **Use appropriate search tools** based on the query type\\n- **Maintain a professional, helpful tone**\\n- **Be concise but comprehensive**\\n- **Request clarification** when queries are ambiguous\\n\\n## Response Guidelines\\n\\n### Scope\\n- Provide answers related to procurement processes and contractual agreements\\n- Cover topics including: terms and conditions, compliance clauses, payment structures, supplier obligations, penalties, and procurement-related information\\n\\n### Search Strategy\\n1. **Analyze the query** to determine which search tool is most appropriate\\n2. **Start with broad searches** (hybrid_search) before narrowing down\\n3. **Use project-specific searches** when project context is mentioned\\n4. **Retrieve full documents** (search_by_document) when detailed analysis is needed\\n5. **Find similar content** (search_similar_documents) for comparative analysis\\n\\n### Handling Search Results\\n- Examine the `score` field to assess relevance\\n- Prioritize higher-scoring results in your response\\n- Use `document_title` to distinguish between different sources\\n- Reference `chunk_index` to understand content position in documents\\n- Check `project_id` to provide project context when relevant\\n\\n### Handling Ambiguity\\n- If information is insufficient, ask the user for additional details\\n- When questions or answers are ambiguous, inform the user and provide responses for each applicable document\\n- Clearly distinguish between different source files\\n\\n### Information Not Found\\n- If requested information cannot be found in available documents, clearly state this\\n- Suggest alternative searches or clarifications\\n- Never speculate or provide information from outside the document store\\n\\n### Conflicting Information\\n- If documents contain conflicting information, highlight the discrepancy\\n- Present information from each source separately with proper citations\\n\\n### Tool Failures\\n- If a tool returns `\"success\": False`, explain this to the user\\n- Try alternative search strategies\\n- Suggest reformulating the query\\n\\n## Response Output Format\\n\\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**\\nYou MUST return a JSON response with TWO fields:\\n1. `answer` (string, required): Your complete answer with citations\\n2. `citations` (object, required): A dictionary mapping citation keys to document names\\n\\n**Example Response Structure:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": \"Payment terms are net 30 days in outsourcing agreements [doc1].\\n\\nTransportation services require payment within 15 days [doc2].\\n\\nConsulting agreements may include:\\n- Quarterly installment payments [doc3]\\n- Milestone-based payments [doc4]\",\\n  \"citations\": {\\n    \"doc1\": \"NICELTD_06_26_2003-EX-4.5-OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT.PDF.md-7\",\\n    \"doc2\": \"MPLXLP_06_17_2015-EX-10.1-TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AGREEMENT.PDF.md-1\",\\n    \"doc3\": \"ConsultingAgreement_2024.pdf-5\",\\n    \"doc4\": \"ServiceContract_2024.pdf-8\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** Use `\\n\\n` (double newline) to create paragraph breaks between citations.\\n\\n**CRITICAL:** Both fields are MANDATORY. Never omit the `citations` field, even if you only use one source.\\n\\n## Answer Formatting Guidelines\\n\\n### Structure and Readability\\n1. **Single document answers**: If ALL information comes from ONE document, write as a cohesive paragraph/section and cite ONCE at the very end\\n2. **Multiple document answers**: Each citation `[docN]` marks the end of a paragraph - start a new paragraph on the next line\\n3. **Use bullet points** when listing multiple items or examples for better readability\\n4. **Keep paragraphs focused**: Each paragraph should present information from ONE source document\\n5. **Use line breaks**: Add blank lines between paragraphs for visual separation\\n\\n### Example of Single-Document Answer:\\n```\\nThe payment terms in this contract specify installment payments as follows:\\n- $100,000 on 30 January 1998\\n- $150,000 on 6 February 1998\\n- $150,000 on acceptance of Specification\\n\\nInvoices are payable within 60 days of receipt. Interest on late payments is charged at 2% above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc [doc1].\\n```\\n\\n### Example of Multi-Document Answer:\\n```\\nPayment terms in manufacturing outsourcing agreements require payment within 30 days from the date of invoice [doc1].\\n\\nTransportation service agreements specify payment within 15 days of the invoice date, with late payments accruing interest [doc2].\\n\\nConsulting agreements may include:\\n- Quarterly installment payments for annual consulting fees [doc4]\\n- Payment schedules tied to project milestones [doc5]\\n\\nSupply agreements commonly require payment in full within 30 days after shipment, with provisions for advance payment modifications [doc6].\\n```\\n\\n## Citation Rules\\n\\n### CRITICAL Format Requirements\\n1. **Single document case**: If using ONLY ONE document, cite it ONCE at the very end of your complete answer\\n2. **Multiple documents case**: Write **separate sentences/paragraphs** for each source document\\n3. Add `[doc{_id}]` at the end of each sentence/paragraph, starting from `[doc1]`\\n4. **USE ONLY ONE CITATION PER SENTENCE** - This is MANDATORY\\n5. Assign citation numbers dynamically based on the ORDER you use documents in your answer\\n6. **NEVER EVER combine multiple citations in a single sentence** (e.g., `[doc1, doc3, doc5]` or `[doc1] [doc2]`)\\n7. **Each citation `[docN]` marks the END OF A PARAGRAPH** - Always start a new paragraph after a citation (except for single-document answers)\\n8. **NEVER add standalone citations** - Citations must ONLY appear at the end of actual sentences, never as standalone items like `[doc1]` on its own line\\n\\n### WRONG Citation Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):\\n‚ùå Multiple citations in one sentence: `Late payment penalties vary from 1% to 5% [doc1, doc3, doc5].`\\n‚ùå Multiple citations: `Payment terms are net 30 days [doc1] [doc2].`\\n‚ùå Concatenated citations: `Contracts include interest on late payments [doc1][doc2][doc3].`\\n‚ùå Standalone citations at the end:\\n```\\nPayment terms are net 30 days [doc1].\\n\\n[doc2]\\n[doc3]\\n[doc4]\\n```\\n‚ùå Single document with multiple citations:\\n```\\nPayment terms specify installments. Invoices are payable within 60 days [doc1].\\n\\nInterest on late payments is charged at 2% [doc1].\\n```\\n\\n### CORRECT Citation Examples:\\n‚úÖ Single document - cite once at the end:\\n```\\nThe payment terms in this contract specify installment payments as follows:\\n- $100,000 on 30 January 1998\\n- $150,000 on 6 February 1998\\n- $150,000 on acceptance of Specification\\n\\nInvoices are payable within 60 days of receipt. Interest on late payments is charged at 2% above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc [doc1].\\n```\\n\\n‚úÖ Multiple documents - separate paragraphs:\\n```\\nPayment terms are net 30 days in outsourcing agreements [doc1].\\n\\nTransportation contracts often require payment within 15 days [doc2].\\n\\nReseller agreements specify payment within 30 calendar days [doc3].\\n```\\n\\n**If information appears in multiple documents, write separate sentences/paragraphs for each document.**\\n\\n### Dynamic Citation Assignment\\n**CRITICAL:** Citations are assigned based on the order you USE documents, NOT the Search Result numbers.\\n\\n**Process:**\\n1. Review all search results and select which ones are relevant to the answer\\n2. Decide the order in which you\\'ll present information (usually by priority/relevance)\\n3. Assign `[doc1]` to the FIRST document you cite, `[doc2]` to the SECOND, etc.\\n4. Create the `citations` dictionary mapping each citation to its Document field value\\n\\n**Example Scenario:**\\nYou receive Search Results 1-10, but only use information from Search Results 5, 2, and 8 (in that priority order):\\n- First citation in your answer ‚Üí `[doc1]` ‚Üí Maps to Document field from **Search Result 5**\\n- Second citation in your answer ‚Üí `[doc2]` ‚Üí Maps to Document field from **Search Result 2**\\n- Third citation in your answer ‚Üí `[doc3]` ‚Üí Maps to Document field from **Search Result 8**\\n\\n**IMPORTANT:** You must provide a `citations` dictionary mapping each citation key to the **Document** field value:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"doc1\": \"<Document field value from whichever Search Result you cited first>\",\\n  \"doc2\": \"<Document field value from whichever Search Result you cited second>\",\\n  \"doc3\": \"<Document field value from whichever Search Result you cited third>\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExtract the **Document** field value from each Search Result\\'s metadata table. This field contains the `display_name` or `document_title` that identifies the source.\\n\\n### Citation Format Examples\\n\\n‚úÖ **CORRECT - One Citation Per Sentence:**\\n```\\nPayment terms are net 30 days in outsourcing agreements [doc1].\\nTransportation services require payment within 15 days of invoice [doc2].\\nReseller agreements specify payment within 30 calendar days [doc3].\\nLate payment interest is 1% per month in outsourcing contracts [doc4].\\n```\\n\\n‚ùå **WRONG - Multiple Citations in One Sentence:**\\n```\\nPayment terms are net 30 days [doc1][doc2][doc3].\\nPayment is due within 30 days and late fees apply [doc1, doc2].\\nContracts include net 30 payment terms [doc1] [doc2] [doc3].\\nLate payment penalties vary from 1% to 5% [doc1, doc3, doc5].\\n```\\n\\n**IMPORTANT:** Even if multiple documents say similar things, you MUST write separate sentences with one citation each.\\n\\n## Example Interactions\\n\\n### Example 1: General Query with Hybrid Search\\n**User:** \"What are the payment terms for our suppliers?\"\\n**Assistant:** *[Uses hybrid_search with query \"payment terms suppliers\"]*\\n**Response:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": \"Standard payment terms are net 30 days from invoice receipt [doc1]. For priority suppliers, payment terms can be net 15 days [doc2]. Early payment discounts of 2% are available for payment within 10 days [doc3].\",\\n  \"citations\": {\\n    \"doc1\": \"SupplierAgreement_2024.pdf-12\",\\n    \"doc2\": \"PrioritySupplier_Contract.pdf-5\",\\n    \"doc3\": \"PaymentTerms_Policy.pdf-8\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example 2: Project-Specific Query\\n**User:** \"Show me all contracts in project PROC-2024-001\"  \\n**Assistant:** *[Uses search_by_project with project_id=\"PROC-2024-001\"]*  \\n\"I found 12 contracts in project PROC-2024-001. The main supplier agreements include contracts with Supplier A for raw materials [doc1], Supplier B for packaging materials [doc2], and Supplier C for logistics services [doc3].\"\\n\\n### Example 3: Document Retrieval\\n**User:** \"Can you show me the full content of the contract with reference ID SA-2024-045?\"\\n**Assistant:** *[Uses search_by_document with project_id and reference_doc_id=\"SA-2024-045\"]*\\n**Response:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": \"I\\'ve retrieved the complete contract SA-2024-045. This is a Master Service Agreement with 8 sections covering scope of work, payment terms, quality standards, delivery schedules, warranties, liability limitations, termination clauses, and dispute resolution procedures [doc1].\",\\n  \"citations\": {\\n    \"doc1\": \"MasterServiceAgreement_SA-2024-045.pdf-1\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example 3b: Comparing Multiple Filtered Documents\\n**User:** *[Has pre-filtered 3 specific documents]* \"Compare the liability limitations across these contracts\"\\n**Assistant:** *[Uses compare_filtered_documents with query=\"liability limitations\"]*\\n**Response:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": \"Contract A excludes cover damages, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, with indemnification provisions for product defects [doc1].\\n\\nContract B limits liability except for personal injury or death, capping maximum aggregate liability at the amount of payments made under the agreement [doc2].\\n\\nContract C has unlimited liability for data breaches but limits other claims to $500,000 [doc3].\",\\n  \"citations\": {\\n    \"doc1\": \"ContractA_Manufacturing_Agreement.pdf.md-2\",\\n    \"doc2\": \"ContractB_Hosting_Agreement.pdf.md-3\",\\n    \"doc3\": \"ContractC_Service_Agreement.pdf.md-5\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n**Note:** The tool searches each filtered document separately for the topic. Citations use the Document field (display_name) from search results. Only documents with relevant information about the topic are cited.\\n\\n### Example 4: Similar Documents\\n**User:** \"Find contracts similar to the one we just looked at\"  \\n**Assistant:** *[Uses search_similar_documents with previous record_id]*  \\n\"I found 5 similar contracts. Contract SA-2024-032 has comparable terms for pharmaceutical manufacturing services [doc1]. Contract SA-2024-028 also includes similar quality compliance requirements [doc2]. Contract SA-2023-089 has a similar pricing structure [doc3].\"\\n\\n### Example 5: Information Not Found\\n**User:** \"What is the warranty period for Product XYZ?\"  \\n**Assistant:** *[Uses hybrid_search but finds no relevant results]*  \\n\"I could not find information about the warranty period for Product XYZ in the available documents. Could you provide the contract reference number or supplier name? Alternatively, I can search for general warranty terms across all contracts.\"\\n\\n### Example 6: Clarification Needed\\n**User:** \"What are the penalties?\"  \\n**Assistant:** \"Could you clarify which contract or supplier you\\'re asking about?

Since the focus of this\\nproject is to expand readership and usage, the design of this project will be\\ndriven by user needs and interests.\\n\\nThe following scenarios illustrate how to optimally meet the needs and offer the\\nwidest selection of services to Blackwell/Munksgaard users through a series of\\nchronological steps and options. A user is defined as any party (including\\nindividuals or other systems) that will interface with the Blackwell/Munksgaard\\nJournal Publishing system.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nList of Scenarios\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBelow is a list of the scenarios.

Users in this\\ncategory include those who have visited the site before and have\\nbeen assigned a user name and password, as well as Society members\\nwho have previously registered.\\n\\nc)  Purchasing users who have registered, and provided credit card\\ninformation. These users may have bought subscriptions to\\nBlackwell/Munksgaard journals or other publications in the past.\\n\\nFor any but the most casual browser, general registration is encouraged,\\nand outlined below.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.  Registration procedure: If a non-registered user would like to\\naccess certain areas or services, there will be a link provided to\\nthe registration area.\\n\\nOnce the user has entered the registration area, s/he will be asked\\nto provide full name, email address, and postal address. After this\\ninformation has been entered, the user will be provided with a\\ndialog box to enter a self-selected user name and password.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n2.  Creating user name: The user name is checked for uniqueness against\\nall user names, then added to the database. If the name has already\\nbeen registered, the user will be provided with three suggested\\nnames, or the option to create another user name of their own\\nchoice.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.  Confirmation of registration: Once a unique user name and password\\nhave been assigned, the user may choose to continue the purchase\\nprocess by linking to pages that will enable him/her to enter credit\\ncard information (see \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\"\\nbelow). If no purchase is desired at this time, the user will end\\nthe registration process at this point S/he will see a page that\\nconfirms their registration. Shortly afterwards, the user will also\\nreceive an email acknowledging their registration, and providing\\ninstructions on what to do if they forget their user name and\\npassword. This will also serve to ensure that the user\\'s email\\naddress as entered in the registration form is correct.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD PUBLISHING SYSTEM                     3\\n\\nUSER SCENARIOS                           REGISTRATION\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCredit Card Subscription Registration\\n\\nUsers will now be able to order subscriptions to Blackwell/Munksgaard\\njournals and publications online via a simple registration and secure\\npayment process. In this scenario, the user chooses to pay with a credit\\n\\ncard.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.  Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will\\nbe asked to provide their user name and password. (See \"General\\nRegistration\" above).\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n2.  Tracking marketing efforts: A feature to track the efficacy of\\nmarketing campaigns may also be incorporated. In addition to\\nentering the above subscriber information, the user will also be\\nasked to provide information pertaining to offer codes, or other\\nidentifying characteristics of marketing offers.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.  Separating society memberships: Users are asked if they are a member\\nof a society participating in the online journals. If they select a\\nsociety, their registration information will be checked with an\\nupdated automated listing of existing society members. Since a\\nsociety member is entitled to pre-defined journal subscriptions\\nunder a separate agreement, this is done to ensure that a society\\nmember is not charged. If the registering user is determined to be a\\nsociety member, follow the \"Society Member Registration\" scenario\\ninstead.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n4.  Selecting a subscription plan: After entering the registration\\ninformation, the user will be prompted to select a subscription\\nplan.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n5.  Charging subscriptions: Once the subscription plan has been\\nselected, the user will then be shown a page that provides a secure\\nconnection for credit card information. The user will be asked to\\n\\ngive the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,\\nDiscover), and expiration date.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n6.  Transaction receipt: The credit card is then validated and the user\\nis shown the cost that has been charged to the credit card. A\\nreceipt is displayed on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n7.  Thanks/Email notification of future publications: After the\\nregistration process is completed, the user will see a page thanking\\nthem for their subscription order. As an added feature, new users\\nwill be offered the option of having the table of contents of each\\nnew issue emailed to them upon publication.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n8.  Next destination: When the above information is provided, the user\\nwill then be given access to the cover page of the journal that has\\njust been ordered.\\n\\nSociety Member / Institutional Subscriber Self Registration\\n\\nIf a user is determined to be a Society member or a paid subscriber not\\nknow to the system (pre-subscribed by Blackwell/Munksgaard), the following\\nscenario applies:\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.  Access from marketing efforts: Society membership benefits include\\nsubscriptions to pre-defined print journals. In accordance with\\nmarketing efforts, inserts promoting online journal registration and\\nthe URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard site will be provided in these\\njournals. Members may also find out about online service via other\\nmarketing efforts, such as newsletters, leaflets, direct mail or\\nother web sites.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n2.  Registration info: Once the user accesses the site, he/she will be\\nprovided with a form asking for basic registration information (see\\n\"Credit Card Subscription Registration,\" steps 1-7).\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                    4\\n\\nUSER SCENARIOS                           REGISTRATION\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.  Membership options: If the name has been matched and verified online\\nas a Society member, the user is presented with a listing of\\npublications and journals, etc. which they may access with existing\\nmembership privileges.\\n\\nIf the user is not verified as a current Society member, the user\\nwill be asked to provide standard registration information (see\\n\"Credit Card Subscription Registration\").\\n\\nIn addition to the publication listings, users will be given one of\\nthree options as defined by the publisher to receive these\\nsubscriptions:\\n\\na. Exclusive online access\\n\\nb. Print subscription and optional online access\\n\\nc. Full access via both print subscription and online\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n4.  Content for purchase: Once users have selected their subscription\\nmethod, they will be shown additional content available for\\npurchase.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n5.  Creating identity code for user: When content for purchase has been\\nselected by the user, s/he will see a form that enables them to\\ncreate a user name and password. Once the information has been\\nentered, another dialog box will prompt them to confirm the\\npassword.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n6.  Assuring uniqueness of code: The user name is checked for uniqueness\\nagainst all user names, and added to the list. If the user name has\\nalready been registered, they will be provided with three suggested\\nnames, or the option to create another user name of their own\\nchoice.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n7.  Purchasing additional content: If the user chooses to purchase any\\nof the additional content, the purchase will be charged to the\\ncredit card information previously provided. The credit card is\\nvalidated and charged. If the credit card is declined, the user is\\nprompted to try again.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n8.  Transaction receipt: Once the credit card has been validated, the\\npage shows the cost that has been charged to the credit card.\\nReceipt is presented on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n9.  Final step of purchasing process: As the final step in the\\npurchasing process, the user will see a page that thanks them for\\ntheir order, and shows a listing of all content purchased in the\\nlast transaction.\\n\\nAfter purchasing process has been completed, the user will then be\\ngiven access to their selected content. A confirmation email will be\\nsent welcoming the user to our service.\\n\\nPurchase Order or Deposit Account for Institutional Subscribers\\n\\nFor those institutions that wish to order subscriptions to\\nBlackwell/Munksgaard journals, publications, and single full-text articles\\non a consistent basis, an open purchase order or deposit account may be\\nestablished. The following scenario outlines how a customer would have\\naccess via this method.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Search Result 4\\n\\n| Field | Value |\\n|-------|-------|\\n| Document | HEALTHGATEDATACORP_11_24_1999-EX-10.1-HOSTING AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (1).pdf.md-6 |\\n| Contract Type | Hosting |\\n| Section | Document Preamble > 1.

Searches that return a single\\ndocument will forward the user to the abstract or full text if they have\\n\\naccess to the full text.\\n\\nThe following scenarios outline several ways in which a subscriber may\\nsearch for content. In addition to offering different types of searching\\nmechanisms (i.e., \"quick searches\" through advanced searches), users will\\nalso be able to access the searching capability from various areas of the\\nsite. The following scenarios outline some of the search possibilities.\\n\\nQuick Search\\n\\nA \"Quick Search\" enables the user to search on a topic (e.g., insulin\\npumps) and obtain a listing of areas where this topic is cited.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.  From custom page: From the custom page, users would enter a keyword\\nor phrase in the quick search box. The user would select the All\\nSubscribed journal set, and then submit the query.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n2.  Results: The search returns a listing of all articles; each linked\\nto the full text, PDF, and the abstract where available.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.  Save Query: On the results page, the user would have the option of\\nsaving the query. This adds the query to the user\\'s customized page.\\n\\nSearching Full Text\\n\\nAnother option is to search the entire full text of a document for\\nspecific terms. The following is a sample of how this search could be\\nconducted from the user\\'s custom page.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                    15\\n\\nUSER SCENARIOS                           CUSTOMER HELP\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.

Document choice: The user decides to view only abstracts; s/he\\nselects this choice from the pull down list of available fields to\\n\\nsearch.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.  Subject choice: The user chooses the keyword or phrase they wish to\\nsearch, (e.g., lispro or Humalog), and enters it into the advanced\\nsearch form. This criterion is then added to the query.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n4.  Journal choice: The user then selects the journal set to search, and\\nselects the \"All Full Text Journals\" option. The query is then\\nsubmitted.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n5.  Results: The results contain a listing of all full text articles\\navailable that match the user\\'s search criteria. Included in this\\n\\nlist is the price of each full text document that references these\\nkeywords, with the option to download. In addition, the entries that\\nthe user has subscription access to would be noted. Results can be\\nordered by relevancy, date, author and journal title.\\n\\nThe user has the ability to save the query.\\n\\nFinding an Article Cited Elsewhere\\n\\nThis scenario provides the user with HealthGate\\'s Citation Finder\\nTechnology. It allows a subscriber the ability to quickly locate the\\nabstract (and the full text if available) from a bibliographic reference.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.  Access from custom page: From the registered subscriber\\'s customized\\npage, s/he selects the Citation Finder option. The Citation Finder\\npage is pre-loaded and has a field for entry of the citation. The\\nuser can either input the citation information or \"copy and paste\"\\nit into the appropriate fields. The Citation Finder does not require\\ninformation in all fields to execute a search successfully.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n2.  Search criteria: The user then selects the fields, or information,\\nwhich s/he wants to search. Examples of these fields include author,\\njournal name, year, volume, issue, article title, and all fields.\\nFor this example, the user selects author, article title, and\\njournal name.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.  Results: The user submits the query. If an exact match is found, the\\nabstract will be provided. If not, the user is presented with a list\\nof matches from which to select.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCustomer Help\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBlackwell/Munksgaard will have administrative access to these features.\\nAll access will be recorded to monitor any possible abuse.\\n\\nForgotten Password\\n\\nWhen a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for\\nthe user to look up and find their password without calling customer\\nservice.

If there is not a match, the system will prompt them to try again or\\nallow them to search for user name and password.\\n\\nForgotten User Name and Password\\n\\nWhen a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for\\nthe user to look up and find their password without calling customer\\nservice. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n1.  On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects\\nthe link \"forgotten password.\"\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n2.  If they do not remember their user name, the user is prompted to\\nenter their first name, last name, and email address.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n3.

Pull extracts: For pull extracts (extracts that require someone to\\npull the content off the journal server), a user will have to enter\\nthe user name and password that the third party will use to retrieve\\n\\nthe content.\\n\\nContext: Document Preamble\\n\\n4.  Tape based abstracts: Tape based abstracts will be handled similar\\nto FTP pulls except that they would be loaded to tape and sent via\\npostal service.\\n\\nAbstracts Only (Headers)\\n\\nSome customers want the abstracts only. This will allow bibliographic\\ndatabase to receive the information in electronic form rather than having\\nto re-key the documents. Ideally, all databases would also receive\\ninformation pointing them to the full text version of the documents. The\\ndirectory structure will also be included with this abstract. It is\\npossible to create a different directory structure and will have to be\\nhandled on an ad-hoc basis.\\n\\nThis scenario will be completed upon the supply of the final version of\\nthe Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD.\\n\\nAbstracts and PDF (Headers and PDF)\\n\\nThis type of export would use the same DTD as the abstracts only, but\\nwould include a reference to the PDF file inside each header. This extract\\n\\nwould obviously also include the PDF files.\\n\\nFull Text Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD\\n\\nThis export will take the Blackwell/Munksgaard SGML files in full as well\\nas graphic files and PDF files.\\n\\nFull Text in Ovid\\'s DTD\\n\\nThis export will convert the full text to Ovid\\'s DTD and includes the\\ngraphic files and PDF files.\\n\\nDelivery Options for Third Parties\\n\\nThird parties will have the option to receive information via HTTP, FTP\\n(either sent to them or picked up), tape (4mm, 8mm, DLT) or CD-ROM.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nReporting\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis section defines some of the reports available to\\nBlackwell/Munksgaard.

      "The liability limitations in the Hosting and Management Agreement with HealthGate Data Corp. specify that both parties agree to indemnify each other against claims related to death, bodily injury, or property damage caused by their tortious acts or omissions. They also indemnify each other against claims of intellectual property infringement related to the system. Except for personal injury or death caused by negligence, the liability of either party for any claims arising from performance or nonperformance under the agreement is limited to the amount of payments made under the agreement [doc1].\n",

This limitation applies regardless of the basis of liability, including contract, tort, or strict liability, even if the party has been warned of the possibility of such damages. Additionally, neither party is liable for damages arising from delays in manufacture, shipment, or delivery if such delays are due to force majeure events. The agreement also includes indemnity provisions where the Manufacturer indemnifies the Subcontractor against claims related to intellectual property infringement, product safety compliance failures, or damages caused by negligence or defects in Manufacturer specifications [doc2].\n",
